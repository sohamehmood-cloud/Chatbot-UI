# How to Upload to GitHub (Without Git CLI)

If you're having trouble with Git command-line, use one of these methods:

## Method 1: GitHub Web Upload (Easiest)

1. Go to https://github.com and sign in (or create an account)
2. Click **"+"** → **"New repository"**
3. Name it: `wellbeing-chatbot`
4. Description: "Interactive AI chatbot with web and desktop UIs"
5. Choose **Public** or **Private**
6. **Do NOT** initialize with README/gitignore/license (you already have them locally)
7. Click **"Create repository"**
8. After creation, you'll see instructions. Look for **"uploading an existing project"** section
9. Copy the repository URL (HTTPS or SSH)

## Method 2: GitHub Desktop (Recommended)

1. Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Click **File** → **Add Local Repository**
4. Browse to `e:\Soha_CS_1st_Sem\Lab project`
5. It should detect the `.gitignore` and ask to create a repo
6. Click **"Create Repository"**
7. Click **"Publish repository"** button (top right)
8. Sign in if prompted
9. Name: `wellbeing-chatbot`
10. Description: "Interactive AI chatbot with web and desktop UIs"
11. Choose visibility and click **"Publish Repository"**
12. Done! Your repo is now on GitHub

## Method 3: Manual File Upload (If All Else Fails)

1. Go to https://github.com/new and create a repository named `wellbeing-chatbot`
2. After creation, click **"Add file"** → **"Upload files"**
3. Select and upload these files/folders:
   - `main.py`
   - `chat_ui.py`
   - `web_ui.py`
   - `requirements.txt`
   - `wellbeing_library.json`
   - `.gitignore`
   - `README.md`
   - `templates/` folder
   - `static/` folder
4. Add commit message: "Initial commit: Well-Being Chatbot"
5. Click **"Commit changes"**
6. Done!

## Recommended: Method 2 (GitHub Desktop)
It's the easiest and most reliable for your situation.
